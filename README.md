# NN_for_ML_Hinton

The assignments for the Neural Networks for Machine Learning from Prof. Hinton from Coursera 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home/welcome. Since Coursera is transfering to a new platform ( end of 2016), some of the quizzes had problems in grading. I personally found the discussion forum was very helpful. Thanks to all the fellow classmates. 

The code is implemented under Matlab/Octave. Most of the code has already been given, for each assignemnt, users just needed to add/change a small portion. Enjoy ~!
